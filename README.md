# Getting Started with the Vue Context Menu Component
A quick-start Vue project that shows how to get started with the Syncfusion Vue Context Menu component.

The Syncfusion Vue Context Menu is a graphical user interface component that appears when a user right-clicks or performs a touch-and-hold action. The component allows you to create context menus that appear when a user right-clicks on an element or performs a certain interaction. These menus can provide context-specific actions and options for users.  

In this video, you will learn how to configure the Context Menu component with these built in features: item binding, icons, multilevel nesting, display of nesting items on click, navigation links, and animation.  

You can define custom context menus with a variety of items, submenus, icons, and separators. This allows you to tailor the context menu to match your application's look and feel. You can create nested submenus by including an item property within a menu item. You can control the position of the context menu relative to the triggering element, ensuring that it appears in the desired location.
